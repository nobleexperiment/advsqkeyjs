I used to work as a web developer at a previous startup using their in-house proprietary content management system for Financial Advisors. It was built in ASP (legacy version, not the .net platform - very old) using MySQL as it's database on Apache Servers. Very similar to a WAMP stack without the P (trust me, we didn't use any PHP or Python). It was great for what it did. It rendered HTML pages and templates with it's own widgets built in-house. Our only problem was it wasn't compatible with most browsers and mobile devices until the iPhone & android popularized mobile apps to the masses. We recommended our clients to use Microsoft's Internet Explorer to best view our websites and for our Customers (Broker Dealers) to approve web pages for their financial representatives and advisors.

That last suggestion to our clients assumed Microsoft would maintain it's 

That application stood the test of time for a good 18+ years (I think it's still in use), but now that I'm no longer with that startup, I wanted to build a lightweight open source program for Financial Adivsors.

I'm replicating AdvisorSquare in a lightweight JS application. The CRM is based on keystone.js engine utilizing eclipse.js and node.js. This imagines the question: How would AdvisorSquare's CMS be retooled in a MEAN stack with keystone.js. Instead of using widgets, web designers and developers working with financial advisors can use any NPM dependencies. Those dependencies can be from the NPM package manager or proprietary for broker/dealer use only.

In my free time, I'm hoping this would help financial advisors build their own reactive websites as brochures for their existing and prospective clients with the help of contributors like you. It's designed to be simple, cost-effective on any hosting platform (AWS, Google Cloud, etc.) and compliant to any financial regulatory agencies (like FINRA, FSC, FCA, and other regulatory agencies serving Broker/Dealers worldwide).

Keys:

1. Broker / Dealers, Registered Financial Advisors, and Investment Advisors should host their own web platforms at minimal costs without ..

2. Compliance Departments often look for context
